# Automated Legal Case Management System

## Description

This project aims to develop an automated legal case and document management system tailored for law firms. The solution addresses common challenges faced by legal institutions, such as disorganization of documents, difficulty in locating information, and the risk of missing critical legal deadlines. Through centralization and process automation, the system aims to improve the productivity of lawyers, legal assistants, and managers, ensuring greater operational efficiency and reducing errors.

## Project Goals

- **Data Centralization**: Organize and centralize all documents and case-related information in a single system.
- **Process Automation**: Automated alerts to ensure timely completion of critical legal deadlines.
- **Efficient Document Search**: Advanced search functionality to quickly locate documents and information.
- **Increased Productivity**: Reduce the time spent on administrative tasks, allowing professionals to focus on higher-value legal work.

## Features

### 1. Case Registration and Organization
- A module to register and organize legal cases.
- Store documents, petitions, hearings, and other materials related to each case.

### 2. Advanced Search
- A search tool allowing users to find documents and case information quickly using keywords, categories, and other criteria.
- Search results include case files, client data, and associated legal documents.

### 3. Legal Deadline Management
- Automated system alerts and notifications to ensure critical legal deadlines are met.
- Automated reminders and tracking for key dates associated with cases and legal procedures.

### 4. Reports and Overview
- Report functionality for office managers to track deadlines, tasks, and the overall progress of cases.
- Detailed reports on document management, appointments, and deadline status.

## Technologies Used

### Backend:
- **Java** with **Spring Boot**: Provides the backend infrastructure for handling user requests, business logic, and database interactions.
  
### Frontend:
- **Node.js**: Used for handling API requests and serving the frontend application.
- **React.js**: The main framework for building the user interface, allowing for dynamic, real-time updates.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL**: A robust relational database used for storing and managing legal documents, case information, and deadlines.

### Authentication:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Secure user authentication and session management for different user roles (lawyers, legal assistants, and managers).

### File Storage:
- **Amazon S3** or similar services for secure, scalable file storage and document management.

## System Architecture

This system follows a **microservices architecture** with the backend built in **Spring Boot** for the business logic and API management. The frontend is developed with **React.js** and served via a **Node.js** server. Communication between the backend and frontend is handled via RESTful APIs.

- **Frontend**: React.js, communicates with the backend APIs to display data and interact with users.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, handles all server-side logic, database queries, authentication, and business rules.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, stores case data, documents, user information, and deadline tracking.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Java 11 or higher**
- **Node.js** (for the frontend and backend)
- **PostgreSQL** (or another relational database)
- **AWS S3** (optional, for file storage)

### Backend Setup (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/automated-legal-case-management.git
   cd backend
   ```

2. Configure application properties:
   - Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties` to set the database connection URL, username, password, and other necessary configurations.

3. Build the Spring Boot application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

### Frontend Setup (React.js + Node.js)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure API URLs:
   - Ensure the frontend is correctly pointing to the backend API by modifying the `.env` or configuration files.

4. Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database (e.g., `legal_case_db`).
2. Configure the database connection in the Spring Boot `application.properties` file:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/legal_case_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. Apply migrations or create the schema for the database tables used by the application.

## Usage

1. **User Registration and Login**:
   - Register users as either lawyers, legal assistants, or office managers.
   - Use JWT-based authentication to log in and access the system.

2. **Manage Legal Cases**:
   - Create, update, and manage legal cases by adding documents, deadlines, and client information.
   - Search and filter cases and documents quickly using advanced search options.

3. **Deadline Alerts**:
   - Set up critical deadlines for each case.
   - Receive email or in-app notifications for upcoming deadlines to prevent missing important dates.

4. **Reports and Analytics**:
   - Office managers can access detailed reports on the status of cases, deadlines, and task completion.
